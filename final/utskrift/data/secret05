It
is
told
among
the
wise
that
the
First
War
began
before
Arda
was
full-shaped,
and
ere
yet
there
was
any
thing
that
grew
or
walked
upon
earth;
and
for
long
Melkor
had
the
upper
hand.
But
in
the
midst
of
the
war
a
spirit
of
great
strength
and
hardihood
came
to
the
aid
of
the
Valar,
hearing
in
the
far
heaven
that
there
was
battle
in
the
Little
Kingdom;
and
Arda
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
his
laughter.
So
came
Tulkas
the
Strong,
whose
anger
passes
like
a
mighty
wind,
scattering
cloud
and
darkness
before
it;
and
Melkor
fled
before
his
wrath
and
his
laughter,
and
forsook
Arda,
and
there
was
peace
for
a
long
age.
And
Tulkas
remained
and
became
one
of
the
Valar
of
the
Kingdom
of
Arda;
but
Melkor
brooded
in
the
outer
darkness,
and
his
hate
was
given
to
Tulkas
for
ever
after.
In
that
time
the
Valar
brought
order
to
the
seas
and
the
lands
and
the
mountains,
and
Yavanna
planted
at
last
the
seeds
that
she
had
long
devised.
And
since,
when
the
fires
were
subdued
or
buried
beneath
the
primeval
hills,
there
was
need
of
light,
Aule
at
the
prayer
of
Yavanna
wrought
two
mighty
lamps
for
the
lighting
of
the
Middle-earth
which
he
had
built
amid
the
encircling
seas.
Then
Varda
filled
the
lamps
and
Manwe
hallowed
them,
and
the
Valar
set
them
upon
high
pillars,
more
lofty
far
than
are
any
mountains
of
the
later
days.
One
lamp
they
raised
near
to
the
north
of
Middle-earth,
and
it
was
named
Illuin;
and
the
other
was
raised
in
the
south,
and
it
was
named
Ormal;
and
the
light
of
the
Lamps
of
the
Valar
flowed
out
over
the
Earth,
so
that
all
was
lit
as
it
were
in
a
changeless
day.
Then
the
seeds
that
Yavanna
had
sown
began
swiftly
to
sprout
and
to
burgeon,
and
there
arose
a
multitude
of
growing
things
great
and
small,
mosses
and
grasses
and
great
ferns,
and
trees
whose
tops
were
crowned
with
cloud
as
they
were
living
mountains,
but
whose
feet
were
wrapped
in
a
green
twilight.
And
beasts
came
forth
and
dwelt
in
the
grassy
plains,
or
in
the
rivers
and
the
lakes,
or
walked
in
the
shadows
of
the
woods.
As
yet
no
flower
had
bloomed
nor
any
bird
had
sung,
for
these
things
waited
still
their
time
in
the
bosom
of
Yavanna;
but
wealth
there
was
of
her
imagining,
and
nowhere
more
rich
than
in
the
midmost
parts
of
the
Earth,
where
the
light
of
both
the
Lamps
met
and
blended.
And
there
upon
the
Isle
of
Almaren
in
the
Great
Lake
was
the
first
dwelling
of
the
Valar
when
all
things
were
young,
and
new-made
green
was
yet
a
marvel
in
the
eyes
of
the
makers;
and
they
were
long
content.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
the
Valar
rested
from
their
labours,
and
watched
the
growth
and
unfolding
of
the
things
that
they
had
devised
and
begun,
Manwe
ordained
a
great
feast;
and
the
Valar
and
an
their
host
came
at
his
bidding.
But
Aule
and
Tulkas
were
weary;
for
the
craft
of
Aule
and
the
strength
of
Tulkas
had
been
at
the
service
of
an
without
ceasing
fax
the
days
of
their
labour.
And
Melkor
knew
of
an
that
was
done,
for
even
then
he
had
secret
friends
and
spies
among
the
Maiar
whom
he
had
converted
to
his
cause;
and
far
off
in
the
darkness
he
was
filled
with
hatred,
being
jealous
of
the
work
of
his
peers,
whom
he
desired
to
make
subject
to
himself.
Therefore
he
gathered
to
himself
spirits
out
of
the
halls
of
Ea
that
he
had
perverted
to
his
service,
and
he
deemed
himself
strong.
And
seeing
now
his
time
he
drew
near
again
to
Arda,
and
looked
down
upon
it,
and
the
beauty
of
the
Earth
in
its
Spring
filled
him
the
more
with
hate.
Now
therefore
the
Valar
were
gathered
upon
Almaren,
fearing
no
evil,
and
because
of
the
light
of
Illuin
they
did
not
perceive
the
shadow
in
the
north
that
was
cast
from
afar
by
Melkor;
for
he
was
grown
dark
as
the
Night
of
the
Void.
And
it
is
sung
that
in
that
feast
of
the
Spring
of
Arda
Tulkas
espoused
Nessa
the
sister
of
Orome,
and
she
danced
before
the
Valar
upon
the
green
grass
of
Almaren.
Then
Tulkas
slept,
being
weary
and
content,
and
Melkor
deemed
that
his
hour
had
come.
And
he
passed
therefore
over
the
Walls
of
the
Night
with
his
host,
and
came
to
Middle-earth
far
in
the
north;
and
the
Valar
were
not
aware
of
him.
Now
Melkor
began
the
delving
and
building
of
a
vast
fortress,
deep
under
Earth,
beneath
dark
mountains
where
the
beams
of
Illuin
were
cold
and
dim.
That
stronghold
was
named
Utumno.
And
though
the
Valar
knew
naught
of
it
as
yet,
nonetheless
the
evil
of
Melkor
and
the
blight
of
his
hatred
flowed
out
thence,
and
the
Spring
of
Arda
was
marred.
Green
things
fell
sick
and
rotted,
and
rivers
were
choked
with
weeds
and
slime,
and
fens
were
made,
rank
and
poisonous,
the
breeding
place
of
flies;
and
forests
grew
dark
and
perilous,
the
haunts
of
fear;
and
beasts
became
monsters
of
horn
and
ivory
and
dyed
the
earth
with
blood.
Then
the
Valar
knew
indeed
that
Melkor
was
at
work
again,
and
they
sought
for
his
hiding
place.
But
Melkor,
trusting
in
the
strength
of
Utumno
and
the
might
of
his
servants,
came
forth
suddenly
to
war,
and
struck
the
first
blow,
ere
the
Valar
were
prepared;
and
he
assailed
the
lights
of
Illuin
and
Ormal,
and
cast
down
their
pillars
and
broke
their
lamps.
In
the
overthrow
of
the
mighty
pillars
lands
were
broken
and
seas
arose
in
tumult;
and
when
the
lamps
were
spilled
destroying
flame
was
poured
out
over
the
Earth.
And
the
shape
of
Arda
and
the
symmetry
of
its
waters
and
its
lands
was
marred
in
