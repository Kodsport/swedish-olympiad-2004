Min
has
been
traveling
from
Falme
for
months
and
has
finally
arrived
in
Tar
Valon.
She
has
been
sent
by
Moiraine
to
deliver
a
message
to
the
Amyrlin
Seat
and
wants
to
be
out
of
the
city
as
soon
as
it
is
delivered.
She
is
wearing
a
dress
and
is
using
her
real
name,
Elmindreda,
so
that
she
will
not
be
recognized.
Inside
the
Tower
everyone
she
looks
at
has
a
violent
image
around
them.
Many
will
die
and
many
more
will
be
injured
all
on
the
same
day.
Min
is
very
frightened
by
these
revelations.
Outside
the
Amyrlin's
study
she
talks
to
Gawyn
who
is
concerned
about
Elayne,
Egwene,
and
Nynaeve.
Around
him
she
sees
his
sigil
of
the
White
Boar
on
a
green
background
rather
than
a
red
one.
Leane,
the
Keeper,
recognizes
Min,
despite
the
disguise.
Around
the
Amyrlin
Min
sees
a
vision
of
the
women
naked,
accompanied
by
the
feeling
that
something
else
is
wrong
yet
is
unexplainable.
Min
relays
Moiraine's
message
that
Rand
is
traveling
to
Tear.
Siuan
comments
that
it
is
too
soon
for
him.
Min
tells
Siuan
that
she
is
in
love
with
Rand
and
that
she
wants
to
go
to
Tear
to
be
with
him.
The
Amyrlin
intends
her
to
stay
as
bait
for
the
Black
Ajah.
She
will
have
Leanemake
it
look
like
Elmindreda
is
a
young
women
fleeing
two
suitors.
While
talking
to
Gawyn,
Elaida
recognizes
Min.
She
knows
that
Moiraine
and
Siuan
are
friends
and
are
plotting
to
manipulate
Rand.
The
Red
sister
intends
to
stop
them
as
she
believes
that
Rand
will
destroy
the
Royal
Line
of
Andor
and
she
will
not
let
that
happen.
In
a
moment
of
realization
she
considers
the
possibility
that
Rand
might
be
able
to
channel.
She
comes
across
Alviarin
of
the
White
Ajah
while
walking
in
the
hall,
and
they
begin
plans
to
stop
Siuan
Sanche.
Child
Byar
is
with
Dain
Bornhald
just
outside
of
the
Two
Rivers.
Bornhald
has
been
ordered
to
meet
the
man
named
Ordeith
who
is
acting
as
his
advisor.
Ordeith
is
an
insane
little
man.
"We'll
scour
the
Two
Rivers.
We
will
flog
them
and
flay
them
and
seer
their
souls!
I
promised
him!
He
will
come
to
me
now!
He
will
come!"
Bornhald
thinks
Ordeith
is
a
madman
but
ignores
him
for
he
is
intent
on
seeking
revenge
for
his
father.
He
is
seeking
Perrin
Aybara
of
the
Two
Rivers.
Lady
Suroth
is
on
the
isles
of
Cantorin
and
has
taken
over
as
ruler.
She
has
taken
most
of
the
Sea
Folk
and
other
sea-faring
people
hostage
so
they
aren't
able
to
report
the
Seanchan's
presence.
She
has
gathered
a
small
legion
of
Seanchan
that
fled
Falme
six
months
ago
and
she
is
planning
to
lead
the
Return.
She
is
waiting
until
she
can
be
sure
that
the
mainland
has
forgotten
about
the
Seanchan
and
does
not
suspect
that
she
is
there.
Suroth
is
questioning
Pura,
a
captured
Aes
Sedai
who
has
been
made
damane,
about
how
the
Aes
Sedai
control
the
Dragon
Reborn.
The
two
sul'dam
present
are
Taisa
and
Alwhin
who
is
so'jhin,
a
servant
of
the
Blood.
When
Alwhin
and
Pura
have
been
dismissed,
Suroth
talks
of
a
secret
that
only
three
others
know.
One
of
them
is
Alwhin.
Suroth
is
determined
to
lead
the
Return.
